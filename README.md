# chat-app
Basic chat app written in Java with Spring web sockets
## Goal
The goal of this project is to challenge myself to make a working chat application in Java using the Spring framework. There is a specific reason why i chose to make this project: i had no idea, literally, on how to do it. After reading some documentation, reddit posts and threads on stackoverflow i thought that the best way to get this sorted out was to try and make a chat application.
## Roadmap

- [x] Implement chat rooms
- [x] Add database to save users, messages and chat rooms
- [ ] Implement registration for users and creation of chat groups
- [ ] Implement private messages
- [ ] Rewrite front-end with Angular
